## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
